# Quantitative Analysis of School Performance

## Executive Summary

Using Excel, I extract data, clean and process it, and identify trends. This data was uploaded into Tableau and visualized in meaningful ways. Using Tableau, I analysed school performance across Massachusetts, focusing on 4th-grade students as an indicator of future academic success from 1,861 schools serving around 950,000 students across different grades. 

The total graduation rate is 83.33%, which is higher than the rate in other states.
Main insights revealed performance differences among ethnic groups, with Asian and White students generally achieving higher graduation rates compared to Hispanic and Black students. 
Smaller class sizes and early intervention were found to support better academic outcomes.
Focus on the younger grades to get the best results in the future.

## Why I Chose This Project

When I first delved into the world of educational analysis, I found myself curious about the very beginnings of academic journeys. It's this curiosity that led me to focus on 4th-grade performance in Massachusetts schools. The idea that early academic success—especially in subjects like English and Math—could be a clear predictor of long-term achievement sparked my interest. 

## Key Takeaways
Smaller class sizes and early interventions are associated with better school performance and higher graduation rates.
Academic performance based on school type (Charter and public).
Early academic performance, especially in 4th grade, is a strong predictor of future success.
Graduation rate by gender (equitable educational environment).
Correlation between District expenditure and educational success.
Ethnic performance disparities often correlate with resource availability and socioeconomic factors.
Massachusetts school District performance is higher than that of other US states.

## Methodolgy

Using Excel to extract, clean, and turn raw data into meaningful insights through tasks like data cleaning, sorting, and filtering.
Tableau helps users explore data to identify trends and patterns, monitor school performance, and make future decisions.

## Dataset Details
This data is REAL data taken from the Massachusetts Department of Education Website for 2017 (but you can pretend it is last year's). It is actually a combination of multiple reports. The reports can be found here. The compiled data set can be found here. 

## Quantitative analysis

A Hexbin plot shows that Districts with smaller average class sizes tend to have higher overall performance scores, particularly in reading and arithmetic.

The analysis revealed that most schools in the dataset are public institutions. High school graduation in Massachusetts is around 83.33%, which is higher than in other US states.

In Math, the passing rate is 34.85%, whereas in English it is notably higher at 52.55%. The higher English passing rate suggests that students may be receiving more effective support or resources in English than in Math.

According to 2017 data, the average male count was 52% and the female count was 48%. I used a jitter plot to show the number of graduates per school, and a scatterplot to show the male and female counts per school. The male count is higher than the female count.

The average salary for school teachers across districts is $74,000. However, this figure varies from district to district. Notably, Boston offers the highest salaries, which may help attract and retain qualified educators, potentially leading to better student outcomes. On average, each district spends around $0.15 billion annually.

Analysis based on ethnicity shows that Asian and White students typically have the highest graduation rates. In contrast, Hispanic and Black students have lower percentages, often linked to variation in resources across districts and higher representation in high-needs populations.

## Result and Personal Reflections: 
Working on this project was eye-opening. I realized the importance of early academic performance and how it sets the stage for future success. The challenge of addressing ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in education is significant, but it's also an opportunity for positive change. By doing so, we can create a more equitable educational landscape for all students.

Investing in early intervention programs and ensuring equitable distribution of educational resources, especially in under-resourced districts.
Higher salaries and expenditures are likely to improve educational resources, attract better teaching staff, and enhance student support systems.

## NEXT STEPS
Investment Impact: The correlation between high expenditures and educational success in Massachusetts suggests that financial investment in education can lead to higher graduation rates and better overall performance.
Teacher Retention: Offering competitive salaries, particularly in districts like Boston, is critical to attracting skilled teachers, who are essential to student achievement.
Sustained Focus: Maintaining and increasing investment in education could further enhance Massachusetts's standing as a national leader in academic excellence.
